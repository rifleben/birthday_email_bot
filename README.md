# birthday_email_bot
Sends a birthday email using 1 of 3 templates to a person if their birthday is on the current day. 

Part of 100 Days of Code challenge.


I hosted this app on the cloud via PythonAnywhere(Anaconda), and scheduled it with a list of my friends/familly emails. Allows me to not feel horrible for not sending an email for someeone's birthday!
